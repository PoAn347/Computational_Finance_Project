This project is the final project for the course "C++ in Financial Engineering" from Baruch College. Here is the introduction for this project:

Goals and Objectives:
We discuss various methods to price options:

Exact (closed) solutions.
Monte Carlo (MC) method.
Finite Difference method (FDM).
We discuss the fundamental processes and algorithms that describe how to price options. 
The focus is on understanding the mathematical and financial fundamentals in just enough detail so as to be able to implement option pricing algorithms in C++. 
We recommend consulting the internet and other sources (for example, www.datasimfinancial.com) to deepen your knowledge of these topics.

The goals of these exercises are:

Understanding the C++ option pricing code for the above methods; create test programs with various datasets.
Getting used to the code style and learning some basic computational finance.
Making the code more reusable and improving the design to allow for future extensions. In particular, you’ll need to apply the object-oriented and generic programming techniques from previous sections.
Comparing the above different methods with respect to accuracy, efficiency, and stability. Stress testing for the full range of parameters.
Using STL, Boost, and Duffy’s data structures.
It is not expected to have the full financial or mathematical background to the enclosed formulae; the focus is on being able to program these formulae in C++.
